# TextBot
Input a movie script, song lyrics, or some other body of text, and this will text it line-by-line to the number of your choice!

## To Run

First, be sure to have iMessage setup on your Mac, and also ensure that you have a text conversation already started with the person to text.

Next, input the data you want to text line-by-line into the MESSAGE.txt file.

Lastly, navigate to the directory with the script and run it.

```
osascript text_bot.applescript
```
